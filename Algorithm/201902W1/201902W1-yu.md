> 题目：#929 Unique Email Addresses

描述：

Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.

For example, in `alice@leetcode.com`, `alice` is the local name, and `leetcode.com` is the domain name.

Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain `'.'`s or `'+'`s.

If you add periods (`'.'`) between some characters in the **local name** part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.  For example, `"alice.z@leetcode.com"` and `"alicez@leetcode.com"` forward to the same email address.  (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)

If you add a plus (`'+'`) in the **local name**, everything after the first plus sign will be **ignored**. This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example `m.y+name@email.com` will be forwarded to `my@email.com`.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)

It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given a list of `emails`, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many different addresses actually receive mails? 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails
```

解答：

```python
def numUniqueEmails(emails):
    """
    :type emails: List[str]
    :rtype: int
    """
    new_emails = []
    for email in emails:
        local,domain = email.split("@")
        local = local.replace(".", "")
        local = local.split("+")[0]
        print(local)
        new_emails.append(''.join([local,domain]))
    return len(set(new_emails))
```

主要是列表的操作，日常处理可能会经常碰到，没什么技术含量。
