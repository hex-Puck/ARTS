## 1004 Counting Leaves

A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree. Your job is to count those family members who have no child.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0<*N*<100, the number of nodes in a tree, and *M* (<*N*), the number of non-leaf nodes. Then *M* lines follow, each in the format:

```
ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
```

where `ID` is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, `K` is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit `ID`'s of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be `01`.

The input ends with *N* being 0. That case must NOT be processed.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no child **for every seniority level** starting from the root. The numbers must be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of each line.

The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where `01` is the root and `02` is its only child. Hence on the root `01` level, there is `0` leaf node; and on the next level, there is `1` leaf node. Then we should output `0 1` in a line.

### Sample Input:

```in
2 1
01 1 02
```

### Sample Output:

```out
0 1
```

### Solutions

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<int> v[100];
int book[100] = {0};
int maxdepth = -1;

void dfs(int index, int depth) {
    if(v[index].empty()){
        book[depth]++;
        maxdepth=max(maxdepth,depth);
        return;
    }
    for(int i=0;i<v[index].size();i++)
        dfs(v[index][i], depth+1);
}
int main(){
    int n, m, node, k, c;
    scanf("%d %d", &n,&m);
    for (int i=0;i<m;i++) {
        scanf("%d %d", &node, &k);
        for(int j=0;j<k;j++){
            scanf("%d", &c);
            v[node].push_back(c);
        }
    }
    dfs(1,0);
    printf("%d", book[0]);
    for(int i=1;i<=maxdepth;i++)
    printf(" %d", book[i]);
    return 0;
}
```
