Zara has unveiled a new, curvier logo - but not everyone is a fan.The fast-fashion retailer recently revealed the updated logo, which replaced its former easily-recognised logo, on its website and social media accounts.Unfortunately, consumers are less-than-impressed with the new branding, designed by the Baron & amp; Baron agency - as the letters are quite cramped.In addition to overlapping all of the letters, a curve has been added to the bottom of the Z and the R, making for text slightly difficult to read.The style is also not unique - as HypeBeast pointed out it is the signature typography of artistic director and Baron & amp; Baron founder Fabien Baron. People mocked the brand's latest appearance - and questioned who approved the crowded design."Whoever is responsible for the new Zara logo, I just want to talk." one person wrote.Another said:" This new Zara logo is wrong in so many aspects that it's hard to synthesise in one tweet. Nonsense kerning, absurd letter spacing, lack of uniqueness." Designer Erik Spiekermann also expressed his distaste for the new logo."That is the worst piece of type I've seen in years," he tweeted. "Was this done by one of those new robots that will replace humans?"

Zara 换了一个新的，有曲线的标志 - 但不是每个人都喜欢。这家快时尚零售商最近在其网站和社交媒体账户上发布了更新的标志，取代了之前易于识别的标志。不幸的是，消费者对 Baron&amp 设计的标志不是很满意-因为这些非常难辨。除了重叠所有字母外，还在 Z 和 R 的底部添加了一条曲线，让整个标志更看不清。新的风格也不独特 - HypeBeast 指出它是艺术总监及 Baron&Baron 创始人 Fabien Baron 的标志性排版。人们嘲笑该品牌的最新标志 - 并质疑谁批准了这种设计。有人说 "无论谁负责新的 Zara 标志，我只想和他谈谈。" 还有人说“这个新的 Zara 标志在很多方面都很怪，很难在一条推文中总结出来。无意义的字距，荒谬的字母间距，缺乏独特性。” 设计师 Erik Spiekermann 表示不是很喜欢这个新标志。
